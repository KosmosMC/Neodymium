# üêõ Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is open for the following things:

-  Terrain Generation and Structure Bugs
-  Gameplay Bugs
-  Gamebreaking Glitches
-  Performance Issues

There will not be support for versions below 2.1.2. You could likely fix most issues by updating to a more modern version.

# üõ†Ô∏è Mod Suggestions

In order to suggest a mod to the modpack, you should open an issue with the following information:

- Send the Mod Link (Preferably Modrinth, as Curseforge projects require manual approval or may not be able to be used at all.)
- State what the mod does
- State how the mod would fit into the modpack

# ‚ùì Hardware Compatibility

Neodymium may not be compatible with very old or not mid-range powered systems.
If your Graphics Card was made within the last 10-11 years, it should hopefully be compatible. The modpack ___is___ very performance intensive, however.
Please allocate at least 4-5GB of ram or more for better performance. You may not be able to run it on the default settings if your hardware isnt the greatest.
