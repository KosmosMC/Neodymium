<summary>Things to note!</summary>
This modpack ever so often usually undergoes some large breaking change. Which may break your world. Always backup your worlds before updating.

- Any major "season" of Neodymium is not compatible with one another. 1.x.x worlds will not work on 2.x.x and 2.x.x wont work on 3.x.x versions.

- Please do not report issues that were made due to changes you made. Changes like these are not supported by Me (omoso), serpo or Theorem.
